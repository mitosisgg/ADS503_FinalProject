## Objective

This research made use of the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset to capture the relationships between biometric and lifestyle variables and predict for the presence or absence of specific sleep disorders. To achieve this, we trained and evaluated several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, to predict whether or not an individual may have a sleep disorder. With this model, we seek to screen patients in order to recommend them to sleep specialists for improving their sleep health. We also hope that this research can help reveal the most important factors that affect sleep, providing insights that may support future research.
